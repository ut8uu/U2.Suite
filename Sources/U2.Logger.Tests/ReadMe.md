# U2.Logger.Tests project

The project is aimed to test all the features of the U2.Logger.
The project uses both TDD and BDD approaches. 

## TDD

TDD stands for Test Driven Development, when you write tests before the implementation is done.
This approach is good when you definitely know all the possible scenarios before the work on the project is started.
The approach is applicable when you need to make small tests checking some small unit.

## BDD

BDD stands for Behavior Driven Development, when you are going to test the behavior of the entire system or some of its subsystem.
The other name is itegtation testing, when you test how some parts of the application can interct each other.

This project uses the [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) to write scenarios and test the feature.
To be able to add features and scenarios from the Add New Item dialog in the Visual Studio, please install the SpecFlow Extension using the Extension Manager of the Visual Studio.
